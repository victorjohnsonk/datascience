## Introduction
Data science is the trending thing in the world. Even people without computer background is trying to get familiar with data science or are trying to get hands on experience in data science. Setting your system for data science is one of the challenges most of the beginners face. They either dont know what all softwares to install,how to install and how to configure the system for data science.This guide will explain you on how to configure your system for data science. In this guide you will understand, how to install python and its dependencies for datascience.

## Getting Started
First let us figure out what all we require

#### The first thing
`Python`

Now obviously you will think which version to install? I always use two version lower to the present version.
Say if current version of python is `3.6.x` then I suggest you to install `3.4.x`
But why? You will be wondering why should you install two versions lower,right? Ok I will tell you the reason.
We will require many `python dependencies` (In simple words, the pakages we install along with python to acheieve our tasks. Like to plot a graph,we can install `matplotlib` library)to be installed along with python. Not all these packages are provided by python. So we need to get it from the respective developers. So what happens if yo install the latest version of python? Well, you will find it difficult to get a package which is compactible with the latest version of python. But packages for older versions will be available. So it is better to install 2 versions lower.

> Please Note : Python is preinstalled in Ubuntu. Just open the terminal and type `python` and click enter. 

Now [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) python by going to official python website.Select the version and you can navigate to the bottom of the page where you can see the installation files for download.Download and install as you install any software. Usually python will be installed in C Drive. The path will be like this : `C:\Python34`,
Which will be different for you based on your installation directory. (In general, C:\PythonXX : here XX will be your version.In my case its 34 which corresponds to version 3.4)
